## Introduction
Source Dynamo is a code automation tool that is cross-platform, tech stack agnostic, and IDE agnostic, allowing for in-place code generation based on a central dataset.

Whether you are writing code with or without AI assistance, Source Dynamo allows you to propagate that code throughout your architecture.

Ideal for enforcing code patterns and automating boilerplate code.

Please see the wiki for instructions on how to use Source Dynamo:
